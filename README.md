## Abstract:
The use of machine learning methods for accelerating the design of crystalline materials usually requires
manually constructed feature vectors or complex transformation of atom coordinates to input the crystal
structure, which either constrains the model to certain crystal types or makes it difficult to provide chemical
insights. Here, we develop a crystal graph convolutional neural networks framework to directly learn material
properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal, providing a universal and interpretable representation
of crystalline materials. Our method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory
calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with various structure types and compositions
after being trained with 104 data points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the
contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using an example of perovskites, we
show how this information can be utilized to discover empirical rules for materials design

The following Figure explains that how the structure of solid state physics can be transformed to a Graph structure.
