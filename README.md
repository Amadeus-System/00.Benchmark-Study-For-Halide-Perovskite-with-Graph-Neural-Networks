Repository for my CGCNN research record

## OverView:
Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN) is an example of Graph Convolution Network (GCN) in the field of solid state physics. 
It can be used as a useful alternative calculation tool in the field of DFT (Density Functional Theory).

The following Figure explains that how the structure of solid state physics can be transformed to a Graph structure.
